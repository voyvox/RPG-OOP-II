    //private because we want to encapsulate this data so it isn't changed by other means. Getter setter going to be anticipated to be needed. A convention is use the underscore to show this is the real unchangeable variable, and that the non-underscore merely accesses this and then uses that non underscore version from then on.

    //the initializer CAN change these if you pass them in...? (clarify)
    //clarification to above comment: it does not change them. An initializer creates an instance of a class, so you are creating objects on the fly using the class structure. this is why you can set these values NOW in the initializer, but assigning them to the getters so that you use the getters not the private vars.
